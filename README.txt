Hi Homies, release when i got 50 stars.
The generator is written in Golang, Python, Javascript (yes).


- If you want to bought the src and i keep it private dm me, 1k$ otherwise i will make it public and all gen will be patched another time.
Solving time average ~20-30-50s depend if the proxies is fast.
- Low proxy usage, 0% Lock with home ip (if you got locked that was proxy blacklist problems, i have somes great result with scanned proxies).


I can already make my solver for free for everyone here is all the API hosted on my VPS for you <3:

  - api's node ip: node01.proxies.gay + node02.proxies.gay.
  
  #1: HCaptcha image recognition:
    -> http://node01.proxies.gay:1337/check/image_type/image_link
    -> Image type and link need to be base64 encoded.
    -> Image type is like "please click on motorbus", so the type is motorbus.
    -> Image link is that: https://imgs.hcaptcha.com/FLyfrp/cXRi14Lj3ljqSIuJU=TWBemWgcdI+4CY2gLongUrlYouCareLol
  
  #2: HCaptcha solver:
    -> http://node-ip/random-string-here?site_key=site_key_here&proxy=proxy_here
    -> Discord's /register endpoint site key: 4c672d35-0701-42b2-88c3-78380b0db560
